OSVirt-FunTest project:

1 - Introduction 

OSVirt-FunTest aims to provide tools for recording and automatically 
test operation system images. It uses the same concepts of virtual 
machines usage and its screens capture to make assertions of the operation 
system user input flow execution as used in the os-autoinst project. Some key points 
and motivation for the development of new kind of the same system are to 
turn as easy as possible the test cases creating and maintenace
having as principle the idea that QA tester should not need to program
or at least in the average cases have to know about programming to 
build functional test cases. OSVirt-FunTest uses mainly QEMU 
technology but also aims to provide multi virtualization
support in future and is developed in Python for easily maintenance 
and extensibility what could also make it later in a great framework 
for operation system functional testing.
